# CPP Mastery Journey

Welcome to my C++ learning journey repository! Here, I'm documenting my progress as I become proficient in C++ programming.

## First app: Calculate Your Age

- **Objective:** This app serves as my initial foray into C++, where I learned to use input and output functions, declare variables, and reuse them.
- **Description:** "I Calculate Your Age" is a basic program that prompts the user for their birth year and calculates their age, demonstrating my early grasp of essential C++ concepts.
- **Key Learnings:** Input/output handling, variable declaration, and basic calculations.

Stay tuned for more exciting apps and exercises as I continue to explore the world of C++!
